# PrrojectOrquidea2023

This is a holistic study project on programming languages. Contains a Prolog interpreter, a LISP interpreter,
an OOP language (similar syntax as C,C++,C sharp,Java), OOP (Aspects), and functional programming.
In addition to the programming language: an improved switch, data object wrappers, full implementation of operators (
if Data Oriented Programming comes, we will be up to date).
The project switch: [casesOsUse], is the result of frustrating experiences with the switch of many programming languages,
allows conditional operators, not just equals, plus greater, smaller, equal, greater than equal, etc... and expressions as cases, not just constant values.
Operators come from other frustrating experiences, many programming languages ​​extend operators
arithmetic, conditionals, but not custom operators such as [dot], [?]. This covers a gap and prepares
the groundwork for Data-Driven Programming, if it ever comes.

In the next updates, structured programming commands will be described, but you can check them with the HTML documentation.
